## Settings Overview  

We will briefly explain all the options for better understanding and usage.  

### 1. OpenAI API Key  
Hagen operates with the OpenAI API. You need to connect your API key here. Refer to our previous article for detailed instructions on obtaining your API key.  

---

### 2. Model  
OpenAI provides different types of AI models. Hagen supports all publicly available content-based API models.  

- **GPT-3.5-Turbo or ChatGPT**:  
  ChatGPT models are optimized for dialogue. However, in Hagen, you can use them for regular use cases without the dialogue style. The performance of `gpt-3.5-turbo` is on par with **Instruct Davinci**.  

- **Davinci**:  
  The most powerful instruct-based model in OpenAI.  

- Other Models:  
  You can also try using the following models:  
  - **Curie**  
  - **Babbage**  
  - **Ada**

### 3. Default Content Language  
Select your default AI-generated content language here. You can always change the output language in the **AI generation sidebar** while generating content.  

---

### 4. Temperature  
Temperature is a parameter that influences the creativity or randomness of the generated text.  

- **Higher Temperature (e.g., 1.0)**:  
  Produces diverse, creative, and unexpected responses.  

- **Lower Temperature (e.g., 0.2)**:  
  Produces more focused, deterministic, and repetitive responses.  

ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**: Keep the Temperature value at **1** for a good balance.  

---

### 5. Max Token  
Max Token sets a limit on the length of the generated text, allowing you to control the size of the output.  

- For longer blog posts, set Max Token to the maximum level (**370**). This allows generating longer articles (~1500 words) without interruptions.  
- To save costs, use the default Max Token settings.  

---

### 6. Presence Penalty  
Presence Penalty controls the repetition in generated text. Adjusting this parameter helps reduce the tendency of the AI model to repeat phrases or words too frequently.  

---

### 7. Frequency  
Frequency refers to how often a specific word or phrase appears in the generated output. By adjusting the frequency value, you can control how prominently certain words or phrases appear in the response.
